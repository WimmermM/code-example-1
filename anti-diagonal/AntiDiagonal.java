   /**
   * Create and test a method called `getAntiDiagonalAvg` that takes a multidimensional array (only integers)
   * which represents a square matrix, as a parameter and retruns the average of the numbers in the anti diagonal.
   *  - write test for 2 different scenarios
   * 
   * Example cases:
   * [
   *   [1, 2, 3],
   *   [3, 4, 6],
   *   [5, 2, 5]
   * ] 
   * Should return 4, because (3 + 4 + 5) / 3 = 4. 
   *
   * [
   *   [3, 5, 11, -2],
   *   [3, 1, 7, 4],
   *   [5, 0, 2, 9],
   *   [21, 7, 8, 2]
   * ]
   * Should return 6.5, because (-2 + 7 + 0 + 21) / 4 = 6.5.
